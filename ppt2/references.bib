abstract = "In this paper the attention is focused on the effect of various VOF methods on efficient and accurate simulation of free surface water waves. For this purpose, we will compare several VOF methods in numerical simulations of propagating waves where strong nonlinear behavior is dominant in the flow. Comparisons and discussions will be provided to underline the significance of free surface modeling on the accuracy of wave propagation.",
